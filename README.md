## Introduction

English | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

MMFlow is an open source optical flow toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

### Major features

- **The First Unified Framework for Optical Flow**

  MMFlow is the first toolbox that provides a framework for unified implementation and evaluation of optical flow algorithms.

- **Flexible and Modular Design**

  We decompose the flow estimation framework into different components,
  which makes it much easy and flexible to build a new model by combining different modules.

- **Plenty of Algorithms and Datasets Out of the Box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary optical flow models, *e.g.* FlowNet, PWC-Net, RAFT, etc,
  and representative datasets, FlyingChairs, FlyingThings3D, Sintel, KITTI, etc.

## License

This project is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Changelog

**v0.4.0** was released in 04/01/2022:

- Support occlusion estimation methods including flow forward-backward consistency, range map of the backward flow, and flow forward-backward abstract difference
